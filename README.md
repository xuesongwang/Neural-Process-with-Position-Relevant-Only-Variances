## Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher.

* `gcc` and `gfortran`:
    On OS X, these are both installed with `brew install gcc`.
    On Linux, `gcc` is most likely already available,
    and `gfortran` can be installed with `apt-get install gfortran`.
    

Install the requirements and You should now be ready to go!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Training

To train the model(s) for off-the-grid datasets, run this command:

```train
python train_1d.py --name EQ --epochs 200 --learning_rate 3e-4 --weight_decay 1e-5
```

The first argument, `name`(`default = EQ`), specifies the data that the model will be trained
on, and should be one of the following:
 
* `EQ`: samples from a GP with an exponentiated quadratic (EQ) kernel;
* `matern`: samples from a GP with a Matern-5/2 kernel;
* `period`: samples from a GP with a weakly-periodic kernel
* `smart_meter`: This dataset is referred from: https://github.com/3springs/attentive-neural-processes/tree/RANPfSD/data 
 To train on smart_meter, you need to change the argument `indir` in the function of `get_smartmeter_df` in `data/smart_meter.py` 
 to your own data path. 
           
To train the models for on-the-grid datasets, run this command:
```train
python train_2d.py --dataset mnist --batch-size 16 --learning-rate 5e-4 --epochs 100
```           
The first argument, `dataset`(`default = mnist`), specifies the data that the model will be trained
on, and should be one of the following:
* `mnist`:This dataset can be downloaded using torchvision.datasets. Change the path `MNIST('./MNIST/mnist_data'...)`
of the function `load_dataset` in `data/image_data.py` to the location of your datasets;
* `svhn`: This dataset can also be downloaded using torchvision;
* `celebA`: This dataset can be downloaded from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

We split the downloaded training datasets into training and validating sets with the proportion: 7:3 and use additional testing sets. 

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on off-the-grid datasets, run:

```eval
python eval_1d.py --name EQ
```
The argument is the same as in train_1d.py. A model called `name` + `_model.pt`
will be loaded from the folder `saved_model`

To evaluate my model on On-the-grid datasets, run:
```eval
python eval_2d.py --dataset mnist --batch-size 16
```
The argument is the same as in train_2d.py. A model called `dataset` + `_model.pth.gz`
will be loaded from the folder `saved_model`

## Results

Our model achieves the following log-likelihood (displayed in mean (variance)) on the on/off-the-grid datasets:



| Model name         | EQ              | Matern         |  Period       | Smart Meter   |

| Model name         | MNIST           | SVHN           |  celebA       | miniImageNet   |
